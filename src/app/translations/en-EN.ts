        I am Tomek - a craftsman and enthusiast of historical reenactment. My journey into the world of historical reenactment began around 2008, and during this time, I had the opportunity to explore many charming places in Poland.
        These days, I specialize in faithfully portraying characters from two fascinating epochs: the Middle Ages, including the period around the Battle of Grunwald, and the 18th century in America.
        For many years, I have also successfully worked as a programmer in private companies. Learn more about my passion for historical reconstruction and craftsmanship.
