        My name is <strong>Tomek</strong>, and I am a <strong>craftsman</strong> and <strong>historical reenactor</strong>.
        My adventure with the world of historical reconstruction has been going on for quite some time since 2008.
        I had my first contact with this extraordinary hobby in Świebodzin, my hometown. This small town in the Lubuskie Voivodeship in western Poland has a lot to offer: numerous monuments and rich museum collections.
        So it’s no wonder that I quickly found new interests in myself.
        Over time, I started repairing or creating my equipment - and the <strong>passion for craftsmanship</strong> remains with me to this day.
        `,
        preSummary: `
        With each new season, I develop my passion not only in my hometown but also on numerous reenactment trips.
        Thanks to them, I have visited many charming corners of Poland and met wonderful friends.
        `,

        summary: `
        A craftsman, reenactor, and engineer - these are the words that best describe me.
        I specialize mainly in the accurate recreation of two fascinating eras: the Middle Ages (especially the period around the Battle of Grunwald) and the 18th century in America.

        Are you thinking about a new idea?
        There was this beautiful jade pin at the museum, and you can’t stop thinking about it?
        Or maybe you need new arrows?
        No challenge is too big for me.
        In my projects, I deal with various fields: from precise axe embedding to sewing a large tent.
        Let me know, and together we will create something wonderful.
